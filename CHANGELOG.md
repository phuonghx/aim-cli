# Changelog

All notable changes to AIM are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.2] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed
- **Bundled MCP config** (`.aim-agents/mcp_config.json`) was invalid JSON (it
  contained a `//` comment) and showed an unrelated example server. It now
  registers the `aim` MCP server, so it can be copied straight into `.mcp.json`
  or `.cursor/mcp.json` to expose AIM's tools to a client.
- **Generated instruction files** (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, …) hardcoded
  "45 skills"; the agent/skill/workflow totals are now counted from the bundle
  at sync time so they never go stale (now 20 personas · 55 skills · 13 workflows).

## [1.0.1] - 2026-06-23

### Changed
- CI and the release pipeline now **install the built package** and smoke-test it
  (`aim --version`, `aim init`, `aim lint`) on Ubuntu and Windows. Packaging or
  entry-point regressions — missing `package_data`, a broken console script —
  now fail the build instead of only surfacing for end users. The release job
  additionally installs the exact wheel it is about to publish before uploading.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-23

Initial public release of **AIM (AI Memory / Mind)** — a zero-dependency CLI that
unifies memory, tasks, docs, and instructions for AI coding assistants.

### Core
- `aim init` / `aim sync` — compile a single source of truth (`.ai-context/`) into
  `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, `GEMINI.md`, and
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Content outside the AIM markers is preserved.
- `aim ingest` — import existing hand-written rule files into AIM.

### Tasks & specs
- Task hierarchy with subtasks, dependencies, labels, and acceptance criteria, plus
  an ASCII Kanban board (`aim task`, `aim board`, `aim status`).
- `aim spec new` — scaffold requirements / design / tasks with **EARS** acceptance
  criteria; `aim spec import` and `aim spec coverage`.

### Memory
- Persistent project/global memory with an `importance` score; ranked recall via
  `aim memory context` and the `get_memory_context` MCP tool
  (relevance × importance × recency).
- `aim doctor` — deterministic context-drift detection (stale memory vs git history,
  broken references, duplicate IDs); CI-friendly.

### Integrations
- Zero-dependency **MCP server** (`aim mcp`) exposing tasks, docs, and memory over
  stdio to any MCP client.
- Two-way **GitHub Issues / Projects** sync (`aim github`).
- Local **web dashboard** (`aim browser`) — Kanban, knowledge graph, and a Health
  tab; bound to localhost with a per-session token.

### Tooling
- `aim lint` — validate bundled `SKILL.md` files against the Agent Skills conventions
  (`--fix` folds the legacy `when_to_use` field into `description`).
- `aim upgrade` plus an interactive "new release available" check — runs at most once
  a day, only in a TTY, and opts out with `AIM_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`.
- Optional `[semantic]` extra for embeddings-powered search and duplicate detection.
- A bundled suite of specialist agents, skills, and workflows.

### Notes
- Time tracking and user management are frozen; see
